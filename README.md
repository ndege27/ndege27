👋 Hi, I’m @ndege27!

I’m a passionate Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics enthusiast with a strong interest in ethical hacking, RAM forensics, malware analysis, and security automation. I love exploring system logs, hunting anomalies, and turning complex data into actionable insights.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced RAM forensics techniques, malware reverse engineering, and applying AI tools to cybersecurity challenges.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source security projects, capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, digital forensics research, and tools that help make systems more secure.

🔧 On GitHub, you’ll find my projects, scripts, and experiments related to cybersecurity, malware analysis, and forensic investigations. I enjoy building practical solutions that others can learn from and contribute to.
